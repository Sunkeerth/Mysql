-- 1.  ORDER BY Clause â€” Used for Sorting
-- ğŸ”¹ What it does:
-- It sorts the result of a SQL query based on one or more columns.

-- By default, it sorts in ascending (ASC) order, but you can also sort in descending (DESC) orde.
-- Syntax:

-- SELECT column1, column2
-- FROM table_name
-- ORDER BY column1 ASC|DESC;

-- 2. GROUP BY Clause â€” Used for Grouping Rows :
-- What it does:
-- It groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.
-- Usually used with aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN().

-- Syntax:

-- SELECT column1, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2)
-- FROM table_name
-- GROUP BY column1;

-- 3 .HAVING Clause â€” Used for Filtering After Grouping :
-- What it does:
-- Works like WHERE, but WHERE is used before grouping, and HAVING is used after GROUP BY.
-- Helps to filter grouped data (i.e., after applying GROUP BY).

-- Syntax:

-- SELECT column1, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2)
-- FROM table_name
-- GROUP BY column1
-- HAVING condition;

-- | Clause     | Purpose                      | Used With         | Example Usage          |
-- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
-- | `ORDER BY` | Sorts the result             | Any query         | `ORDER BY salary DESC` |
-- | `GROUP BY` | Groups rows by column values | Aggregate queries | `GROUP BY department`  |
-- | `HAVING`   | Filters grouped data         | After `GROUP BY`  | `HAVING COUNT(*) > 5`  |
